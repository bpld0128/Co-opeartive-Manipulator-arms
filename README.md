# Co-opeartive-Manipulator-arms
Compute and simulate the kinematics and trajectory generation of Cooperative manipulator arms

This is a Robot Modelling project.
Two 5-DOF Robotic manipulator arms are used to depict the cooperative manipulation using Forward and Reverse Kinematics.
The Geometric approach is slightly harder for a 5 DOF robot therefore algebric approach was used to obtain the joint angles.
DH table was computed and RVC toolbox was used to visualize the simulation and trajectory generation.
